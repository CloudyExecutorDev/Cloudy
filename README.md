## Potential Issues

Although Cloudy Executor is regularly updated and generally stable, there are a few considerations:

- **Game Updates**: When Roblox releases a new update, the executor may temporarily lose compatibility until a patch is released.
- **Device Limitations**: On lower-end mobile devices, performance might be slightly reduced.
- **Community Scripts**: Not all third-party scripts are safe. Always check the source before executing any Lua code.
- **Risk of Ban**: While Cloudy Executor includes an anti-ban system, using scripts in public servers still carries some risk. It's best to test scripts on alternate accounts.
